# Morse Code Translator

This project involves creating a Morse code translator that can convert text between English words/sentences and Morse code, using tests to ensure its functionality.

- The translator will take user input from the DOM (Document Object Model) and display the translations below.

This project aims to solidify my knowledge of Typescript, SCSS and HTML.

## Features

1. Translation from English to Morse Code:

   - Users can input English words or sentences into an input box
   - The translator will provide the corresponding Morse code translation.

2. Translation from Morse Code to English:
   - The translator should also be capable of converting Morse code input back to English text.
