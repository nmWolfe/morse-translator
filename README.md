Morse Code Translator README

This project involves creating a Morse code translator that can convert text between English words/sentences and Morse code, using tests to ensure its functionality. The translator will take user input from the DOM (Document Object Model) and provide translations accordingly.
Features

    Translation from English to Morse Code: Users can input English words or sentences into an input box, and the translator will provide the corresponding Morse code translation.

    Translation from Morse Code to English: As an extension, the translator should also be capable of converting Morse code input back to English text.
